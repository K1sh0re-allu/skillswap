# SKILLSWAP

Final Project For Tech For Mobile Apps

SkillSwap is a mobile app that allows users to exchange skills with others in their community. This is an app that helps people trade skills with others in their community. It's like swapping favors: you teach someone something you're good at, and they can teach you something in return. Whether it's cooking, coding, or anything in between, SkillSwap makes it easy to learn new things from anyone from anywhere and make new friends along the way.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out securely.
- Currently I did not used a database for storing login credentials, so I added some hardcoded usernames and passwods in an array in userCredentials.js file.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- React Navigation

 ## Installation

- Since I can't upload all my project files and folder to github due to git hub limitation to an upload upto 100 files, I decided to upload the core files and images.

 ## Instructions

- Create an expo app using "npx create-expo-app skilwap" command
- Download the files in this repository
- Replace/add these files in the project root directory
- Add the images to the ./asset folder of the project directory
- Run "npx expo start"
- Install the expo go app in your smartphone
- Scan the QR code given in the terminal and you should be able to see my app
- Alternatively you can press "w" to open the web browser where my app is emulated in a localhost web browser.
